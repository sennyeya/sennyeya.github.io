# Aramis Sennyey

Hey, I'm a software developer currently working on Backstage! I'm a maintainer for the [OpenAPI tooling](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/blob/master/OWNERS.md#openapi-tooling) on the project. You can see my contributions [here](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/pulls?q=+is%3Apr+author%3Asennyeya).

At the moment, my main interest is developer experience. I think Backstage is doing great work for developers and really excited to be helping them improve the project's own internal DX. I like schema-first development, client generation, and type inferencing.

I'm also working on [a VSCode plugin for Backstage](https://github.com/sennyeya/vscode-backstage).
